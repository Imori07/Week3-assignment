# Week3-assignment

# Credits to joe for the walking skeleton, alex and frankie for help on gameSaveData, w3schools in general and the 2 bits ai saved me with

# For the second time, i completely forgot about pushing my code to github through my work but ill be absolutely sure to do so next time. However this assignment definetely provided a challenge, especially with saving game data, refering to w3schools saved me a lot through most of the work.

# Ive managed to complete all the requirements as well as reach for 2 stretch challenges due to the extra day we had to do this assignment. (consolidating upgrade management + error handling) i feel as though with more time i couldve potentially achieved all stretch goals.

# Ive become confident in the use of event listeners and functions as well as timers. However i definetely need more work on api as i tried spending a lot of time on making it work however i ended up resorting to the use of ai for assistance. Ive also tried to keep my code well annotated so that im able to go back to it if i need help with something later on that i used well in this assignment. I spent a good chunk of time working on the styles however it was fun making it look good.

# I tried providing how each line of code works through it but it does look very messy, i wanted some feedback on how i could do this better because its something i want to carry on doing but i dont want it to get so messy to the point im confusing myself, so i wanted to know if there was an extension or something that could help somehow. Other than that any tips and tricks that could make my code shorter, so like any sort of short cuts i could use.
